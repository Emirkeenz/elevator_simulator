This is elevator simulation. The project was written in C++. 
I used STL containers such as queue, to handle the logic with passengers, and vector, to handle the logic calling elevator and moving it between floors.
For generating passenger on floors I used simple random functionality.

The programm shows such things as calling elevator from some floors, exiting it at some floors, frequency of calls from each floor, frequency of exiting from elevator from each floor, total time needed for all calls and the amount of passengers.
