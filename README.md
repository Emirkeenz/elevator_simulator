# Elevator Simulator
The project utilizes C++ and employs STL containers like queue to manage passenger logic and vector to handle elevator calls and floor transitions. Simple random functionality is employed to generate passengers on floors.

The program displays various aspects such as elevator calls from different floors, passenger exits at specific floors, call frequency from each floor, exit frequency from the elevator on each floor, total time required for all calls, and the total number of passengers.
