The project is written in C++, using STL containers such as queue, to handle the logic with passengers, and vector, to handle the logic calling elevator and moving between floors.
For generating passenger on floors I used simple random functionality.

The programm shows such things as calling elevator from some floors, exiting it at some floors, frequency of calls from each floor, frequency of exiting from elevator from each floor, total time needed for all calls and the amount of passengers.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- make

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
```Bash
git clone git@github.com:Emirkeenz/elevator_simulator.git
cd elevator_simulator
```

2. Build the project using the Makefile
```Bash
make
```

3. Run the executable
```bash
./main
```
